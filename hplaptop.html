    <h1> How I came upon having the name Hplaptop </h1>
    <h6> Date Created: 22/12/2020</h6>
    <!-- Paragraph lol -->
    <p>One evening I was playing some modded GTA V and FiveM used my laptops default username as my games username since I didn't have a steam or a forum account linked. I decided it would be a good idea to change my steam name to HpLaptop instead.</p>
