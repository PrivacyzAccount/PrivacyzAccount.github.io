    <h1> How I came about having the name hplaptop... </h1>
    <h6> Date Created: 22/12/2020</h6>
    <!-- Paragraph lol -->
    <p>My name originated while playing modded GTA V ( Grand Theft Auto 5 ), if you did not sign into your forum account or steam account, the application would use your computers username. 
        The server I was on often had this issue so you had to have your steam or forum accounts linked or else you would get kicked. 
        Me being the petty fuck I am decided that I shouldn't spend the 5 minutes and link 1 of the accounts but I simply renamed my steam account to hplaptop and have stuck with that name ever since.</p>
